Requirements

Before setting up and running the Invoice Generator App, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

    Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.

    npm (Node Package Manager): npm is typically included with Node.js installation, so you should have it available. You can verify its presence by running npm -v in your terminal.

    Git: You'll need Git for cloning the project repository and version control. Download it from git-scm.com.

    SQLite: Since the app uses SQLite, you don't need to install it separately. Prisma will handle database creation and management.

    Prisma CLI: Install the Prisma CLI globally using npm with the following command:

```bash
    npm install -g prisma
```

Next.js: The app is built with Next.js. You can install it globally or use it as a project dependency. To install it globally, you can use:

```bash
npm install -g next
```

However, it's recommended to keep it as a project dependency (which is already in your package.json), so you can use it via npm run commands.

Tailwind CSS (optional): If you want to customize the app's styling using Tailwind CSS, you can install it by following the official installation guide at tailwindcss.com.

Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file in your project root and set your environment variables, such as database connection details and any other sensitive information. You can refer to the "Configuration" section in the README.md for more details.

With these requirements met, you should be ready to set up and run the Invoice Generator App as described in the "Installation" section of the README.md.

Features

    User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and securely manage their invoices.

    Create Invoices: Users can easily create new invoices, add line items, specify due dates, and add customer information.

    Invoice Management: Users can view and manage their invoices, including marking them as paid, editing, or deleting them.

    Invoice PDF Generation: The app generates PDF invoices that can be downloaded and shared with customers.

    SQLite Database: Prisma is used to interact with an SQLite database, making data storage and retrieval efficient and reliable.

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invoice-generator-app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
    cd invoice-generator-app
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
    npm run dev
```

    Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Configuration

Before running the app in production, make sure to configure the following:

    Database Configuration:
        Open the prisma/schema.prisma file and configure your database connection details (e.g., SQLite file path or other database URL).

    Authentication:
        Configure authentication methods and settings in the app as per your requirements. You might want to integrate with a service like Auth0, Firebase, or implement your custom solution.

    Environment Variables:
        Store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secrets in environment variables for security. Create a .env.local file and add your environment variables there. You can use a library like dotenv to load these variables into your app.

Usage

    Once the app is running, create an account or log in.
    From the dashboard, you can create new invoices, edit existing ones, or mark them as paid.
    Generate PDFs for invoices by clicking on the "Download PDF" button.
